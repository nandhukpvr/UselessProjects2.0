### Project Description
Step right up and prove your artistic skills with the Perfect Circle Challenge! This interactive web game, built using p5.js, scores your freehand circle-drawing abilities with a witty, yet brutal, algorithm. Can you beat the impossible?

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Our project solves the age-old dilemma of settling bar bets about who can draw the most perfect circle. It‚Äôs a definitive, objective arbiter for an argument that has plagued humanity for millennia.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've reverse-engineered the secrets of the perfect circle from ancient geometry texts and a grumpy protractor. Our algorithm, fueled by pure digital spite, mercilessly analyzes your handiwork. It doesn't just score your circle; it judges it, using a highly sophisticated, multi-layered system that checks for perfect form, a closed loop, and the correct path length. A single flaw is enough for the algorithm to declare your creation a "wobbly potato."
